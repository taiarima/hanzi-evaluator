# hanzi-evaluator
This is a tool for helping you evaluate approximately how many hanzi (Chinese characters) you know. It works by 
testing you in the form of a multiple choice quiz, using randomly generated prompts. The difficulty of the prompts 
is dynamically adjusted according to the user's performance. At the end, the user is given an estimate of 
approximately how many hanzi you know.

I made the tool primarily to aid students of Chinese to evaluate their knowledge of hanzi to help guide study
goals and measure progress.

The tool is up and running at https://taiarima.github.io/hanzi-evaluator/ , but I will still be making improvements 
gradually. Please feel free to leave commments, raise issues, or submit pull requests.
