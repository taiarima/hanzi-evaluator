            This is a program designed to evaluate your current level of
            knowledge of hanzi (Chinese characters) as used in Mandarin Chinese.
            You will be presented characters and be asked to select the correct
            pronunciation and meaning in English in a multiple choice format. At
            the end of the test, you will be given an estimate of the
            approximate amount of Chinese characters you know.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of the test is to give you an idea of how many Chinese
            characters you know in order to help you evaluate your current level
            and guide your study goals. The test will take approximately 5-10
            minutes to complete. Please consider giving feedback for this tool
            if you found it useful or interesting.

            <h1>Test your Hanzi Knowledge</h1>
            <p>
              The goal of this test is to estimate the amount of hanzi you know.
              You will be presented with a hanzi prompt, and be asked to select
              the correct pronunciation and definition from four choices. If you
              do not know the answer, you can simply click the "I don't know"
              button. Submitting "I don't know" has the exact same effect as
              submitting an incorrect answer. You are encouraged, however, to
              not guess if you are unsure of the correct answer. Guessing or
              using process of elimination when you are unsure of the answer
              will result in a more inaccurate calculation of your knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              The test should take 5-10 minutes. You must complete the entire
              test to see your results.
            </p>
            <p>
              Results given are an estimation. If you would like a more accurate
              calculation of your knowledge, try taking the test multiple times
              and averaging your results.
            </p>
            <p>Good luck!</p>

              This application was made with the goal to help you estimate how
              many Chinese characters (hanzi) you know. It uses the 6,000 most
              commonly used Chinese characters, as identified by the PRC
              Ministry of Education. Test prompts have been randomized, so you
              are guaranteed to have a unique experience every time you take the
              test. While the application's algorithm has been carefully
              designed to accurately assess your knowledge, the random nature of
              the test means your score may vary between evaluations. Take the
              test multiple times and average your results to get a more precise
              assessment.
